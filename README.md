# Handling-Outliers

Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in the dataset. Identifying and managing outliers is essential to ensure the robustness and accuracy of your models. Here's an overview of how to handle outliers effectively:


Identifying Outliers

Statistical Methods:

Z-Score: Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Points with a Z-score > 3 or < -3 are typically considered outliers.
IQR (Interquartile Range): Points outside the range [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR] are considered outliers.
Visualization Techniques:

Box Plot: Visualizes the distribution of data and highlights outliers.
Scatter Plot: Effective for identifying outliers in two-dimensional data.
Histogram: Reveals the frequency distribution and helps spot outliers.

Handling Outliers

Removal:

Filtering: Remove data points identified as outliers. Use this method cautiously as it may lead to the loss of valuable information.
Transformation:

Log Transformation: Helps in reducing the impact of outliers by compressing the range of data.
Winsorization: Limits extreme values by converting them to less extreme values.
Imputation:

Mean/Median Imputation: Replace outliers with the mean or median value of the dataset.
Algorithmic Approaches:

Robust Algorithms: Use models less sensitive to outliers, such as tree-based methods (e.g., Random Forest) or robust regression techniques.
